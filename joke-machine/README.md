## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - For structure
- **CSS3** - For styling and animations
- **JavaScript** - For dynamic content and API interactions
- **Fetch API** - For making HTTP requests to joke APIs
- **Web Share API** - For native sharing functionality

## üì° APIs Used

The application fetches jokes from the following APIs:

- [JokeAPI](https://jokeapi.dev/) - For general and programming jokes
- [icanhazdadjoke](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/) - For dad jokes
- [Chuck Norris IO](https://api.chucknorris.io/) - For Chuck Norris jokes

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Internet connection (to fetch jokes from APIs)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/crystal4000/MLH-API-Week-Challenges/tree/main/joke-machine.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd joke-machine
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your browser:
   ```bash
   # On macOS
   open index.html
   
   # On Windows
   start index.html
   
   # On Linux
   xdg-open index.html
   ```

Alternatively, you can use a local development server like Live Server in VS Code.


## üí° How It Works

1. **API Request**: When you click a category button, the application sends a request to the respective API.
2. **Processing Response**: The response is processed to handle different joke formats (single-line or two-part).
3. **Dynamic Display**: The joke is displayed on the page without refreshing.
4. **Sharing**: You can easily share jokes to social media or copy them to clipboard.

## üì± Responsive Design

The application is fully responsive and works on:
- Desktop computers
- Tablets
- Mobile phones
