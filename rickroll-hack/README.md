# Rickroll Hack

## Overview
A seemingly legitimate file conversion tool that pranks users by rickrolling them instead of actually converting files. Built as part of the MLH API Week Challenges.

## Description
QuickConvert Pro appears to be a professional file conversion tool that allows users to convert between various file formats. However, when users upload a file and click the convert button, they're greeted with a fake loading screen followed by Rick Astley's famous "Never Gonna Give You Up" music video.

## Features
- Clean, professional-looking UI to make the prank believable
- File format selection dropdowns
- Drag and drop file upload functionality
- Realistic file processing animation with progress bar
- Surprise rickroll video that automatically plays

## How It Works
1. Users select their desired file formats and upload a file
2. When they click "Convert Now," a modal appears with a progress bar
3. After the fake progress completes, the Rick Astley music video appears
4. The modal can be closed, stopping the video

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- YouTube iframe API

## Setup
Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. No dependencies or build steps required.
